# Gradient features extraction and aggregation with PCA and GMM
## Requirements
- `python 3.6 or above`
- `pip install numpy`
- `pip install scikit-image`
- `pip install scikit-learn`
- `pip install opencv-python`
## Code execution
  ### Feature extraction : 
  - run the code [feature_extraction.py](https://github.com/SohamChattopadhyayEE/gradientfeatures-with-PCA_GMM/blob/main/Codes/feature_extraction.py) with adequate data path and file path.
  - The gradient features will be saved as `.npy` file named as `features.npy` at mentioend path.
  ### Fishervector model :
